## üîç Dataset & Problem Statement

- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)  
- **Goal:** To classify whether a given water sample is **potable (safe to drink) or non-potable** based on its chemical attributes.

## üèÜ Implementation Overview

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Visualization**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to analyze feature distributions.  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified missing values and assessed data quality.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Computed feature importance using **Decision Trees & Random Forest**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree Model**
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict water potability.  
- Tuned hyperparameters (**max depth, min samples split, pruning**) using **Grid Search CV**.  
- Achieved **X% accuracy** on the test set.  
- Visualized the **decision tree structure**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest Model**
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** with different tree counts (50, 100, 200).  
- Compared performance with Decision Tree.  
- Analyzed **feature importance** to identify key water quality indicators.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison & Insights**
| Model          | Test Accuracy | Key Findings |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Decision Tree** | **X%** | More interpretable, but prone to overfitting. |
| **Random Forest** | **X%** | More robust, better generalization, higher accuracy. |

üìå *Key Conclusion:* **Random Forest outperformed Decision Trees, but Decision Trees offer better interpretability for legal and regulatory purposes.*

## üìä Results & Key Findings

- **The most important chemical properties affecting potability were:**  
  - **pH Level**
  - **Hardness**
  - **Solids Concentration**
  - **Chloramine Levels**
  - **Sulfate Levels**
- **Decision Trees vs. Random Forest:** While **Random Forest achieved higher accuracy**, Decision Trees were more interpretable.  
- **Legal Considerations:** For regulatory approval, a Decision Tree model may be **safer** due to its transparency in decision-making.
